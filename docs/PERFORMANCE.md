# Performance Optimization Guide

This document outlines the performance architectural patterns, rendering lifecycle optimizations, and battery conservation strategies implemented in the Stellar Nebula frontend.

## 1. Animation Frame Loop Optimization (#380)

### Background & Problem

Web applications utilizing 3D graphics (Three.js / React Three Fiber) and continuous physics calculations frequently consume CPU and GPU cycles on every display refresh tick via `requestAnimationFrame`. When a user navigates to another browser tab or minimizes the browser window, standard animation frame loops can continue firing or accumulate unthrottled cycles, resulting in:

- High idle CPU usage (typically 15% - 40% on modern multi-core devices).
- Severe battery drain on mobile devices and laptops.
- Thermal throttling and device overheating.
- Frame-rate stuttering when returning to the tab due to accumulated deltas.

### Page Visibility API Integration

The Page Visibility API (`document.visibilityState` and the `visibilitychange` event) is now integrated across all animation and rendering components:

- **`usePageVisibility` Hook** (`src/hooks/useAnimationFrame.ts`):
  Tracks tab active state reactively and unsubscribes cleanly upon unmount.
- **`useAnimationFrame` Hook** (`src/hooks/useAnimationFrame.ts`):
  Guards the frame callback against inactive tabs, automatically canceling scheduled `requestAnimationFrame` ticks when `document.hidden` is true, and safely resetting delta timestamps upon reactivation to prevent jump artifacts.
- **`NebulaCanvas` Component** (`src/components/Canvas/NebulaCanvas.tsx`):
  Toggles `@react-three/fiber`'s `frameloop` prop dynamically:
  - `frameloop="always"` when visible.
  - `frameloop="never"` when hidden.
    Setting `frameloop="never"` suspends the internal WebGL rendering pipeline, completely halting shader execution and scene evaluations.
- **`useFrameRateMonitor` Hook** (`src/hooks/useFrameRateMonitor.ts`):
  Suspends frame rate tracking during inactive periods, preventing skewed FPS metrics and saving background cycles.

### Results & Acceptance Criteria

- **Idle Inactivity**: CPU utilization falls to ~0% when the tab is hidden.
- **Seamless Resumption**: Canvas and animations resume smoothly without jump-cuts upon tab reactivation.
- **Battery Optimization**: Significantly reduces power draw on mobile browsers and portable devices.

### Utility Functions (`src/utils/performance.ts`)

- `isTabVisible()`: Synchronous check for document visibility.
- `onVisibilityChange(onVisible, onHidden)`: Helper to subscribe to visibility transitions.
- `getRecommendedFrameloop(isVisible, mode)`: Returns the appropriate R3F frameloop state (`'always' | 'demand' | 'never'`).
- `getBatteryStatus()`: Reads battery charging state and level if supported by the browser.

## 2. Mobile FPS Optimization (#351)

### Background & Problem

Complex particle fields, custom vertex/fragment shaders, high device pixel ratios, and post-processing effects (such as Bloom and Depth of Field) previously led to frame drops below 30 FPS on mobile and low-end devices, causing perceptible input latency and jittery animations.

### Optimization Strategies

1. **Adaptive Particle Count Calculation (`src/utils/three-performance.ts`)**:
   - Dynamic particle calculation scales particle density based on device capabilities (`calculateAdaptiveParticleCount`).
   - Mobile and low-power tiers automatically reduce baseline particle count from 12,000–15,000 down to 3,000–4,000 particles, preserving visual depth while drastically cutting vertex transformation overhead.
2. **Quality Presets for Low-End Devices**:
   - `low`, `medium`, and `high` graphic presets via `getQualityPreset`.
   - On low/mobile presets, antialiasing is disabled or restricted to mediump shader precision, and expensive post-processing passes (DoF and Bloom) are bypassed.
   - Dynamic DPR clamping restricts device pixel ratio to `1.0–1.5` on mobile screens instead of rendering at native 3x retina resolutions.
3. **Settings Store Integration (`src/store/settingsStore.ts`)**:
   - Added user-facing graphics settings: `graphicsQuality`, `adaptivePerformance`, `targetFps` (45 FPS mobile / 60 FPS desktop), `particleCountMultiplier`, and `lowPowerMode`.
4. **Runtime Performance & FPS Monitoring**:
   - Real-time rolling FPS monitoring (`createPerformanceMonitor`) and UI counters (`showFps` / `fpsMonitoringEnabled`) detect sustained frame drops and degrade non-essential visual fidelity automatically to maintain >45 FPS.

## 3. Three.js Scene Memory Cleanup (#352)

### Background & Problem

Three.js objects, geometries, textures, and WebGL contexts do not automatically garbage-collect when React components unmount. Unreleased GPU memory buffers caused linear memory growth over extended navigation sessions and eventual WebGL context exhaustion crashes.

### Cleanup Implementation

1. **Comprehensive Disposal Utilities (`src/utils/three-cleanup.ts`)**:
   - `disposeGeometry`: Safely frees buffer geometry and vertex attribute arrays.
   - `disposeMaterial`: Releases shader programs, textures in standard slots (`map`, `normalMap`, `roughnessMap`, etc.), and textures referenced in custom uniforms.
   - `disposeTexture`: Invalidates and frees texture buffers from GPU memory.
   - `disposeHierarchy`: Recursively traverses an `Object3D` hierarchy to dispose all descendant meshes, materials, and geometries, and disconnects all children.
   - `disposeWebGLRenderer`: Clears render lists, triggers `gl.forceContextLoss()`, and frees canvas handles.
   - `cleanScene`: Complete one-stop scene purge for component unmount handlers.
2. **Component Lifecycle Disposals**:
   - `NebulaCanvas.tsx`: Upgraded `CanvasResourceCleanup` hook to invoke `cleanScene(scene, gl)` when unmounting.
   - `ProceduralNebulaField.tsx`: Added `useEffect` cleanup hook to dispose `bufferGeometry` and `shaderMaterial` upon unmount or recreation.
   - `useThreeScene.ts`: Reusable hook with built-in automatic resource tracking and teardown.
3. **Automated Memory Leak Testing (`test/performance/memory.test.ts`)**:
   - Automated unit tests verify all geometries, multi-material arrays, textures, object hierarchies, renderers, and hooks release resources without leaks.
